<!Sarah's random tips for updating in the future: Don't touch the title/bg/color etc. Have the live page open so you can visualize what the text will look like. Keyboard character to make the code text is not the apostrophe but the acute (usu same button as the tilde~. Two hashtag/numbers to Bold. One dash to make a list. Hit an Extra return to exit out of the list back to paragraph text. Insert Hyperlink by: bracketing the words to be hyperlinked then without a space put the link in parentheses. Upload event flyers and/or JPEG's by first uploading it with a simple short filename to our img folder then linking to that concisely with /img/filename.jpg.)

## Leadership

Spring 2017 saw us taking sequential steps to establish our new student chapter on campus and in the [LIS Program](http://sislt.missouri.edu/lis/). To facilitate communication we maintain a:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SAAMUSC) profile (est. 12/5/16)
- [listserv](https://po.missouri.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=SAAMUSC-L) (est. 1/31/17)
- [MU ORG](https://orgsync.com/158099/chapter) profile (est. 4/14/17)
- [website](https://saamusc.github.io/) (est. 4/11/17)

We also drafted and then voted on bylaws, approved on 2/18/17 by the membership:
- [SAAMUSC Constitution](/img/SAAMUSC_Constitution.pdf)

In sum, we attended an info session on [1/24](https://orgsync.com/35463/events/1505629/occurrences/3427731) and [4/17](https://orgsync.com/35463/events/1516284/occurrences/3904497), applied for recognition by the MU ORG Office on 2/20 (approved! on 3/23), voted on officers from Mar 6-9, seated our elected, inaugural officers on Mon Mar 13, and submitted our materials to [SAA Council](http://www2.archivists.org/governance/handbook/section13) for consideration at their [May 16-17, 2017](http://www2.archivists.org/groups/saa-council/may-16-17-2017-council-meeting-agenda) meeting.
