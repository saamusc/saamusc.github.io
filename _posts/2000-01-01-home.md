{: .text-purple}


Established in Dec 2016, SAAMUSC builds a learning community and provides professional development and networking opportunities for students interested in the archival profession!

As a Student Chapter of the [Society of American Archivists (SAA)](http://archivists.org/students/chapters) we serve to introduce new archivists into the profession, promote communication among student members nationwide, and ultimately develop leaders of tomorrow's archives profession.
