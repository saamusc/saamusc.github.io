## Professional Development

SISLT offers [Conference Travel Support](http://sislt.missouri.edu/resources/conference-travel-support/) for master's and doctoral students to present at both local and national conferences.

The School of Information Science & Learning Technologies is a member of the [iSchools](http://ischools.org/) organization.

The [SAA Career Center](http://careers.archivists.org/) hosts job postings and career learning resources, and also see [ArchivesGig](https://archivesgig.wordpress.com/). Missouri is home to the [NARA Kansas City](https://www.archives.gov/kansas-city) branch, the [NPRC](https://www.archives.gov/st-louis) in St. Louis, and the [Harry S. Truman Presidential Library](https://www.trumanlibrary.org/).

SAA's 45 [Sections](http://www2.archivists.org/groups/sections) invite you to contribute to professional initiatives. In particular the Students and New Archives Professionals [[SNAP](http://www2.archivists.org/groups/students-and-new-archives-professionals-snap-section)] Section hosts several resources including Student Chapter meetups at the Annual Meetings.

We aim to collaborate closely with the Missouri Association for Museums & Archives [[MAMA](http://missourimuseums.org/)], which hosts an Annual Meeting in October.

SAA's Regional Archival Associations Consortium [[RAAC](http://www2.archivists.org/groups/regional-archival-associations-consortium-raac)] facilitates information exchange between archives organizations across America. Students may also find the Midwest Archives Conference [[MAC](http://www.midwestarchives.org/)], Kansas City Area Archivists [[KCAA](http://www.kcarchivists.org/kcaa/)], and Association of St. Louis Area Archivists [[ASLAA](http://www.stlarchivists.org/index.html)] helpful.
