# Our Activities

We organize activities and events related to archives on Mizzou's campus and in Missouri. Our officers coordinate event planning in collaboration with [SISLT](http://sislt.missouri.edu/student-groups/) student organizations *[LISGSA](https://orgsync.com/47098/chapter)*, the *[ASIS&T Student Chapter](https://orgsync.com/46996/chapter)*, and the *[Learning Technologies GSA](https://orgsync.com/79281/chapter)*, among [others](https://orgsync.com/47259/chapter) at MU. **Below** are some descriptive summaries! More details are in our Annual Reports below.

- March 16, 2017:
  * Today the SAAMUSC had its first event as an official [organization](https://twitter.com/SAAMUSC/status/842739990681542658). We toured the MU Research Reactor ([MURR](https://twitter.com/SAAMUSC/status/842743034936803328)). Tamara Inge, also an SAAMUSC member, coordinated the tour and is an archivist at the MURR. She and our tour guide Mark Beary led us around the facility, provided a technical overview of the reactor, the history of the facility, and defined some nuclear lingo. 
  * MURR is currently the most powerful university research nuclear reactor in the nation, producing 10mW of electricity, though power production is not its main aim. In addition to enabling UM research from various disciplines, the MURR also produces a variety of products for nuclear pharmacuetical applications. 
  * [Documentation](https://twitter.com/SAAMUSC/status/842740437580439556) is [omnipresent](https://twitter.com/SAAMUSC/status/842742679708614658) along with records retention requirements. Tamara described how she and the two other archivists enable institutional memory, by quickly finding the documentation for past studies. So, in addition to peering into the core of an active nuclear reactor and the control room, we saw some archaeometry lab work in progress, viewed the archives of the MURR, and learned about why so many documents are created in such an institution. This was a great example of the importance of the work of archivists in a scientific research or corporate institution. *--Dylan Martin* [[event flyer](/img/SAAMUSCreactorTour.png)]
  
Fall 2016:

- December 3, 2016:
  * We had a great first meeting at the LISGSA Fall Networking Event! We shared lunch, talked about career paths in archives, and shared tips for professional success. After a group discussion, we broke out for a focused chat about the Society of American Archivists - what it is, what it does, and what it provides for new professionals. We also discussed local and regional groups: making connections and laying the practical groundwork for forming a student chapter of SAA.
